  <h1>Alumni</h1>
  <h2>Former TKEs</h2>

  <p>As a fraternity, we feel it is important to keep in touch with previous Fraters and allow a way for them to stay active within the chapter.  We ask that all alumni of the Gamma-Upsilon chapter of Tau Kappa Epsilon, or any former Teke around the Austin area fill out the following forms.  Your information will be sent to our Historian, which will allow us to inform you about the fraternity and upcoming events.  Thank you.</p>
