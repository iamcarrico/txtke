  <h1>About Tau Kappa Epsilon</h1>

  <h2>About The Fraternity...</h2>

  <p>Founded more than a century ago, Tau Kappa Epsilon considers men "not for wealth, rank, or honor; but for personal worth and character." TKE is made up of a very diverse membership, and is the largest college fraternity in the world, with locations at more than 270 colleges and universities across the United States and Canada. Since 1899, more than 235,000 men have accepted the challenge of membership in Tau Kappa Epsilon. They are men of sterling character who have become leaders in business and the community.</p>



  <p>TKE expects serious attention to academic performance. A strong academic record not only prepares a student for success after graduation, but it represents strength of mind to the world. TKE helps our members excel in their academic life and helps them graduate. As well, TKE teaches the basic principles of effective living such as integrity, honesty, and patience, which are core values in our Fraternity. TKE offers young men the opportunity to develop as leaders and prepares them to use those leadership skills throughout their lifetime. Tekes are encouraged to take an active leadership role in community, campus, and chapter activities.</p>


  <p>Our Fraternity is committed to instilling a sense of responsibility and contribution in all our members. The Fraternity encourages members to provide service to their campus and community through international philanthropic activities. Tekes around the world act as a network of friends, which can be beneficial, both personally and professionally.
