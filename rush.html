  <h1>Rush Tau Kappa Epsilon</h1>
  <h2>Becoming a Brother</h2>
  <p>"Rush Week," is the first week of school each semester. During this week, we will be hosting open events to anyone interested in joining Tau Kappa Epsilon. During or after Rush Week, you may be offered a "bid." Bids express the mutual agreement to join between both you and the members of TKE. At the end of Rush Week, we will hold an induction ceremony to welcome you as a Candidate Member of Tau Kappa Epsilon.</p>
  <p>As a Candidate Member, you will start to learn about what it means to be a member of a fraternity. Our new member program is six weeks long, and during these six weeks you will learn about Tau Kappa Epsilon: our history, rituals, and traditions. In our fraternity, scholarship is very important. Candidate members are required to attend study hours three times a week at an on-campus library for two hours each evening. This is the largest time commitment involved in the new member program. Also, the chair in charge of Scholastics maintains close contact with every new member in order to facilitate extra assistance if needed; ie. tutoring or extra study hours. During the new member program, candidate members are encouraged to participate in all chapter functions such as social events, intramural sports, interfraternity events, and alumni events.</p>
  <p>Shortly before rush week, a picture shown above will explain events we are holding for prospective candidate members interested in pledging TKE. Please feel free to join us in any, or all of the events. Unless noted otherwise, all events will meet or be held at our chapter house located at 2525 Nueces Street. If you are unable to view the image, please contact our Rush Captain.</p>
  <h2>What should I do?</h2>
  <p>We are always looking for quality men to join our brotherhood. If you are an incoming freshmen or coming back to The University of Texas at Austin in the fall, fill out the form <a href="http://txtke.org/rushForm.php">here</a> and one of our rush chairs will contact you. </p>
